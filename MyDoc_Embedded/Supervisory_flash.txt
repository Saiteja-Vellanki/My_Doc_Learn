Supervisory flash is used to store the flash boot code or public key for secure boot operation. 
Flash programing operations such as “Erase All”, “Program Row”, and so on are executed from the Arm® Cortex®-M0+ core using its IRQ0 interrupt via system calls.

Cypress psoc6 Supervisory flash (Sflash):

Supervisory flash (Sflash)
In addition to the application flash and AUXflash regions, the flash macros contain supervisory flash (Sflash),
which can store various application-specific data.
Sflash memory is mapped directly to the CPU’s address space; therefore, the firmware or external programmer
can read its content directly from the given address.
These sub-regions are accessible in Sflash memory:
• 0x1600 0800 - 0x1600 0FFF - User area. Up to 32 KB can be used by the application to store arbitrary data.
• 0x1600 1A00 - 0x1600 1BFF - NORMAL Access Restrictions (NAR).
Used for chip protection in NORMAL Life Cycle stage. Be aware that the NAR sub-region cannot be overwritten
or erased if the new data is less restrictive than the existing data.
• 0x1600 5A00 - 0x1600 65FF - Public Key. Used for digital signature of the application.
• 0x1600 7C00 - 0x1600 7DFF - Table of Contents Part 2 (TOC2).
Used to locate various OEM objects such as application(s) start address(es) and format, address of SMIF
configuration structure. Also used during the boot process to apply device initial settings such as clock
frequency configuration, duration of the Listen window, SWJ pins availability and digital signature verification
(authentication).
• 0x1600 7E00 - 0x1600 7FFF - Reserved Table of Contents Part 2 (RTOC2).
Writing to listed sub-regions is not possible when the chip is in SECURE Life Cycle stage. Writing to any Sflash
address outside the specified sub-regions is not possible in any Life Cycle stage except VIRGIN, which is a
factory-only stage.
