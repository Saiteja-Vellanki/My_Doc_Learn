Operating Modes and Privilege Levels

Both CPUs support two operating modes and two privilege levels:

■ Operating Modes:
❐ Thread Mode – used to execute application software. The processor enters Thread mode when it comes out of reset.
❐ Handler Mode – used to handle exceptions. The processor returns to Thread mode when it has finished all exception
processing.

■ Privilege Levels:
❐ Unprivileged – the software has limited access to the MSR and MRS instructions, and cannot use the CPSID and
CPSIE instructions. It cannot access the system timer, NVIC, or system control block. It may have restricted access to
memory or peripherals.
❐ Privileged – the software can use all the instructions and has access to all resources.
In Thread mode, the CONTROL register controls whether software execution is privileged or unprivileged. In Handler mode,
software execution is always privileged.

Only privileged software can write to the CONTROL register to change the privilege level. Unprivileged software can use the
SVC instruction to transfer control to privileged software.

In Handler mode, the MSP is always used. The exception entry and return mechanisms automatically update the CONTROL
register, which may change whether MSP/PSP is used.

In Thread mode, use the MSR instruction to set the stack pointer bit in the CONTROL register. When changing the stack
pointer, use an ISB instruction immediately after the MSR instruction. This ensures that instructions after the ISB execute
using the new stack pointer
